--Mental Health Detection System--

This project is a Mental Health Detection Application that leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning to analyze user inputs and predict potential mental health conditions.
It provides insights based on facial emotion recognition and text-based assessments, giving users a mental health score and feedback.

The project is fully deployed using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.
